<h1>Turning Text into HTML</h1>
<p>
  This exercise involves converting a given skeleton text file into
  a valid, interactive HTML page. The final webpage simulates a page
  where students create accounts for courses at General Assembly.
  Students select a city from a dropdown list, choose from one of
  two courses using a radio button, provide their name, their email,
  and a password, and have the option to uncheck an checkbox that
  automatically signs them up for a newsletter.
</p>

<p>
  This exercise allows us to practice writing valid HTML. The final
  webpage must meet the following requirements:

  <ul>
    <li>The page title should be, "General Assembly Account Creation"</li>
    <li>The "Web Dev" radio button should be selected as default when the page loads.</li>
    <li>Anything entered in the password input should appear as hidden *'s</li>
    <li>
      The "yes" checkbox for subscribing to the newsletter should automatically be
      checked by default when the page loads.
    </li>
    <li>
      All of the inputs should be surrounded in a form that has an action
      pointing to a "success.html" page.
    </li>
    <li>
      Copy and paste all of your HTML into 
      <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">the W3C HTML validator</a>
      and make sure it validates without errors.
    </li>
  </ul>  
</p>

<p>
  Download the skeleton file to get started:
  <a href="skeleton.html">skeleton.html</a>
</p>

<p>The final page should look like this:</p>
